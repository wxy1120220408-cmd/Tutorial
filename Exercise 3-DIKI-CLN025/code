DIKI is a VAE-based neural network for analyzing conformations in Molecular Dynamics trajectories. 
Including codes:
   1. align a dcd trajectory to a reference structure and output a npz file of aligned Cartesian coordinates.
   2. build a VAE model
   3. use HDBSCAN iteratively updating the latent space
   4. plot the similarity heatmap
